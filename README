Install the schema:

sbin/rt-setup-database --dba <dba> \
    --prompt-for-dba-password --action schema \
    --datadir plugins/RTx-AssetTracker-Asset-Dates/etc


The date fields are named identically to the ticket fields internally,
i.e. Starts Started Told Due Resolved, but to the user, they are
changed to Activates Activated Seen Expires Retired, which make more
sense for assets.
